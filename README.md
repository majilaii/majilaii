Welcome to my GitHub Repository

Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am currently looking for job opportunities in London and am excited to showcase some of my recent projects. Below, you will find three of my notable projects: aTypical, aMAZEthing, and Tactic-toe!

aTypical is a project focused on improving typing skills and speed. Features include personalized practice, real-time progress tracking, and customizable practice texts. Technologies used include React, Express, Mongoose, and Typescript.

aMAZEthing is a real-time multiplayer game with a learning component. Algorithms such as Merge Sort and A* pathfinding are visualized to aid in understanding. Built using React, TypeScript, SocketIO, Auth0, and Redux.

Tactic-toe is a web app that allows users to train their own Tic-Tac-Toe AI model and engage in real-time battles. Built using Angular, SocketIO, PostgreSQL, Express, and Passport.js.

Any recommendations and suggestions are always welcome!

Thank you for visiting!

Jacky
