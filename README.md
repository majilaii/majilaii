Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am currently looking for job opportunities in London and am excited to showcase some of my recent projects. In this repository, you will find three of my notable projects: aTypical, aMAZEthing, and Tactic-toe.

aTypical is a project focused on improving typing skills and speed. Development of features including a personalized practice mode, real-time progress tracking, and customizable practice texts, while also providing a real-time type-racing features. Used technologies such as React, Express, Mongoose, and Typescript to develop the project and deployed the project using fly.io and netlify for cloud hosting and continuous deployment.

aMAZEthing is a game where players can engage in real-time multiplayer battles, using various minions to navigate the maze and conquer towers. In addition, it also has a learning component with visualization tools to aid with the understanding of different algorithms, such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding. The app was implemented using React and TypeScript for a smooth and intuitive user experience, SocketIO for real-time gameplay in the maze, Auth0 for server side authentication, and Redux for State controls. I utilized AGILE principles such as frequent communication, regular sprints and stand-ups, and continuous testing to deliver a high-quality product on time.

Tactic-toe is a web app that allows users to train their own Tic-Tac-Toe model using reinforcement learning. Players can also engage in real-time Tic-Tac-Toe battles to see which AI model is better trained. I implemented the app using Angular, SocketIO, and PostgreSQL, enabling real-time player interaction and efficient data management. I also utilized Express and Passport.js for server-side routing and authentication to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.

I am always looking to improve and learn from others, so feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting!

Jacky
